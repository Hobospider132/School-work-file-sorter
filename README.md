# School-work-file-sorter
SWFS By Hobospider132 V5 (May only have 1 or 2 more updates)
Hi
This is a small perl program that will sort out your school files for you.

V6:
So, i decided to update this thing after a while. The previous version was robust and required a lot of manual work.
If you wanted to look for basenames that weren't added it was not possible and adding directories or basenames were a hassle.
I tried to make an update for it in perl and I really didn't know enough about perl. I decided to make V6 in python which is easier for me to understand
and is more well known. It's currently broken but this is more of a progress update. Message me on discord at Hobospider132#4056 if you want to help out.

V7:

Add gui alternative?
