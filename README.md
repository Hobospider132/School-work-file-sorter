Hi
This is a small perl program that will sort out your school files for you
a few things you will need to do in order to edit this program is:
Change $destfolder, the find files part, name of the school folders 
also make sure you have the following perl modules installed from activestate perl
strict
warnings
File::Basename
File::Find
File::Copy
hopefully you were able to understand those instructions, if not let me know and i will include a tutorial
